Oakiss
------

Oasis[0], but with a KISS[1] repo attached.
I really like Oasis Linux, but I also wanted to utilize kiss for its simple 
package management.
Hence this repos existence.

Goals for this repo:
- Stay close to upstream if relevant
	- aswell as contributing with ours if relevant
- Piggyback opkg[2] when its relevant for this project
- Prefer Oasis' buildsystem where its feasable


Installation
------------

Installation follow the same steps as Oasis.
Please see Oasis' relevant documentation for this.

Regarding KISS, see relevant documentation[3][4][5]
